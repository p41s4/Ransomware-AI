                THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
                     AKIRA RANSOMWARE
============================================================

1. THREAT ACTOR IDENTIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------
The threat actor is identified as the Akira ransomware group, also
known as:

- Akira
- PUNK SPIDER
- GOLD SAHARA

References to this actor appear in multiple advisories and reports,
including CISA Alert aa24-109a and research from various security
vendors and threat intelligence sources.

No additional narrative or assumptions are made beyond these
identifiers and references.


2. SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------
The Akira ransomware group was first observed in March 2023. It has
been speculated that the group may have ties to the former CONTI
ransomware group, although this remains unconfirmed speculation.

After the cessation of CONTI, affiliates reportedly migrated to
other ransomware operations such as Royal and BlackBasta. Akira
affiliates are also believed to collaborate with groups like Snatch
and BlackByte.

The initial Akira ransomware variant was developed in C++ and
appended the ".akira" extension to encrypted files. It dropped a
ransom note named "akira_readme.txt" and was partially based on
Conti V2 source code. A decryptor for this version was released by
Avast on June 29, 2023.

By July 2, 2023, a new version was released to fix a decryption flaw.
This variant was developed in Rust under the filename "megazord.exe"
and changed encrypted file extensions to ".powerranges".

Akira targets both Windows and Linux systems, with a focus on
corporate networks and VMware ESXi servers. The group employs a
double extortion model, encrypting files while exfiltrating sensitive
data and threatening to publish it on a Tor-based leak site.

Initial access vectors include brute-force attacks against Cisco VPN
devices using single-factor authentication, as well as exploitation
of vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-6693 and CVE-2022-40684.

Ransom demands typically range from $200,000 to over $4 million and
are usually requested in Bitcoin. Akira has affected organizations
across education, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors.

Akira does not operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and
continues to evolve with improved encryption performance and
evasion techniques.


3. OPERATIVE MODEL AND OBSERVED CAPABILITIES
------------------------------------------------------------
Observed techniques include:

- Use of valid domain and local accounts (T1078, T1078.002)
- Exploitation of external remote services and public-facing
  applications (T1133, T1190)
- Account creation for persistence (T1136.001, T1136.002)
- Command execution via PowerShell, CMD, WMI, and services
  (T1059 family, T1047)
- Defense evasion through disabling security tools and registry
  modification (T1562.001, T1112)
- Credential dumping from LSASS memory (T1003.001)
- Local and remote system discovery (T1082, T1018)
- Use of remote access software for C2 (T1229)
- Lateral movement via RDP and tool transfer (T1021.001, T1570)
- Data archiving prior to exfiltration (T1560.001)
- Exfiltration via web services and unencrypted protocols
  (T1567.002, T1048.003)
- Impact via system recovery inhibition and file encryption
  (T1490, T1486)

No conclusions regarding intent or strategic rationale are drawn.

8. RANSOM NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------
Hi friends,

Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach - are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption.

Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know:

Dealing with us you will save A LOT due to we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank & income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal.

Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help.

The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data.

As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akiral2iz6a7qgd3ayp3l6yub7xx2uep76idk3u2kollpj5z3z636bad.onion.

We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us.

If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions:
