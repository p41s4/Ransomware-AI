                THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
============================================================

Threat Actor: Akira Ransomware
Aliases: PUNK SPIDER, GOLD SAHARA

------------------------------------------------------------
1. THREAT ACTOR IDENTIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------
This report focuses on the ransomware group known as Akira.
Information has been collected from multiple reputable sources,
including:

- CISA
- SentinelOne
- BleepingComputer
- Sophos News
- Securelist
- Trellix
- Sekoia
- Avast

------------------------------------------------------------
2. SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------
The Akira ransomware group first emerged in March 2023. There is
speculation regarding potential ties to the former CONTI
ransomware group following its shutdown, during which affiliates
migrated to independent operations such as Royal and BlackBasta.

Akira affiliates have reportedly collaborated with other
ransomware operations including Snatch and BlackByte, supported
by the discovery of shared tooling.

The initial Akira ransomware variant was developed in C++,
appending the ".akira" file extension and dropping the ransom
note "akira_readme.txt". This version partially reused CONTI V2
source code.

On June 29, 2023, Avast released a decryptor for this early
variant. Shortly after, on July 2, 2023, Akira released a patched
version written in Rust named "megazord.exe", which appends the
".powerranges" extension.

Primary initial access methods include brute-force attacks
against Cisco VPN devices using single-factor authentication,
as well as exploitation of CVE-2019-6693 and CVE-2022-40684.

Akira targets both Windows and Linux environments, including
VMware ESXi servers, and operates under a double extortion model.
Sensitive data is exfiltrated prior to encryption, with threats
of public disclosure via a Tor-based leak site.

Ransom demands range from $200,000 to over $4 million USD,
payable in Bitcoin. Akira is assessed to operate independently
rather than as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform and
continues to evolve its tooling and evasion capabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. OPERATIVE MODEL AND OBSERVED CAPABILITIES
------------------------------------------------------------
Observed operational techniques include:

- Use of compromised VPN and domain accounts
- Exploitation of public-facing services (Cisco VPNs)
- Creation of local and domain accounts for persistence
- Execution via PowerShell and Windows Command Shell
- Use of Windows services and WMI for execution
- Defense evasion using PowerTool and Zemana drivers
- Registry modification to disable security controls
- Credential dumping from LSASS (Mimikatz, LaZagne)
- Network and system discovery using multiple tools
- Command and Control via legitimate remote access tools
- Lateral movement using RDP and tool transfer
- Data archiving prior to exfiltration
- Exfiltration using cloud and FTP-based tools
- Deletion of shadow copies and file encryption
